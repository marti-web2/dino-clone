	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>T-Rex Trek is a fun and addictive game based on the popular dino game in Google Chrome that runs when there is a 404 error. The goal of the game is to help the T-Rex character jump over blocks and avoid obstacles as it runs through the prehistoric landscape. As you progress through the game, the difficulty increases, making it more challenging to survive.</p>
	<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
	<p>T-Rex Trek is built using the following technologies:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>: JavaScript is a programming language that is commonly used in web development. It is used to add interactivity and functionality to web pages, such as responding to user input and updating the content of a page dynamically. In T-Rex Trek, JavaScript is used to control the game logic, such as the movement of the T-Rex and the detection of collisions with obstacles.
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">HTML</a>: HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It defines the structure and content of a web page using a series of elements and attributes. HTML is used to create the basic structure and content of the game, such as the layout of the game screen and the text and images displayed to the user.
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS</a>: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. CSS is used to style the appearance of the game, such as the colors, fonts, and layout of the game elements.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Future Work</h2>
	<p>There are several features that I plan to implement in future versions of T-Rex Trek:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>High score board: I plan to add a high score board that allows players to track their progress and compete against other players. This will add an element of competition and replay value to the game.
		</li>
		<li>Customization options: I also plan to allow players to customize the appearance of their T-Rex character, choosing from a variety of colors and skins to create a unique look. This will add more personalization and variety to the game.
		</li>
	</ul>
